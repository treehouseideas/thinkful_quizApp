Thinkful FEWD - Quiz App Project

In the remaining three assignments in this lesson, you’ll work on a single project: designing and coding from scratch an interactive quiz app. Like you did with your shopping list app in Unit 2, you’ll tackle this assignment in three steps. First, in this assignment, we’ll review the requirements for the app, and then you’ll need to design and wireframe your app. Next you’ll create a static version of the app, so you can focus on HTML and CSS. Finally, you’ll write the JavaScript code you need to bring the app to life.

If you didn’t already have a look at the examples we shared in the intro to this lesson, make sure to do so now. It’s up to you to come up with the topic you want to quiz users on and how the app will look and feel. The minimum requirements are as follows:

The app must lead the user through a set of questions. The user should only see one question at a time, with new answers presented only after they have answered the current one.
Users should be able to to input their answer to each question, with radio buttons or some other appropriate interface.
When the user answers the last question, the app should show his or her overall score.
Each question should be stored as a JavaScript object, and you’ll probably want to store your list of questions in an array.
If you are feeling particularly ambitious, consider implementing the following features:

Let the user know where in the quiz they are at each step (i.e. “Question 3 of 5")
Let the user know their score so far
Let the user know if their previous response was correct
Let’s get to it!

STEPS
1) Spend some time thinking about the topic you want to quiz users about it. Pick a topic that you find interesting. 
2) Next spend some time brainstorming how the app you should look and feel. On the one hand, you should consider how to best achieve the functional requirements outlined above. How can you make it easy and intuitive for users to start the quiz, answer questions, and get feedback on their responses? On the other hand, you may choose to let the theme of your quiz affect your design decisions. For instance, if you were creating a quiz app about fishing, you might use use a majestic background of a fisherman casting into a lake. 
3) After you know in general terms what you want to create, it’s time to sketch your app. You’re free to use pen and paper, Photoshop, or a mockup tool like Balsamiq to create your designs. 
4) When you’ve completed your designs, if you’d like feedback from the community, post a picture or pdf of your sketches. 
5) Try to spend about 1 to 2 hours total on this assignment.
